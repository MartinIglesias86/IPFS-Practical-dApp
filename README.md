# App that interact with an Smart Contract to work with IPFS.

In this project I'm going to use [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/), [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to create an app to work with IPFS, with the deployment of the Smart Contract on
the Mumbai test net.
